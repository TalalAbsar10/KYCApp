**Document scanning can be done through below steps.**<br /> 

##Scan from gallery<br /> 
-Once this button is clicked, it will ask the user to grant the permission to access the storage, please allow it.<br /> 
-Once the permission is granted, user can select any document to scan.<br /> 
-Scanning result can be seen on the screen with the user details.<br /> 
 
##Scan from Camera<br /> 
-Once this button is clicked, user will be asked to grant the permission to use the camera, please allow it.<br /> 
-Once the camera is ready, you have to place the document/ID card in the designated area with white border.<br /> 
-Upon successful scanning, the border will turn green and the user will ask to flip the document/ID card, it will again turn white and will turn green upon 
successful scanning.<br /> 
-Once the above process is done, the user can see the information on the screen.<br /> 

**Note: While scanning from the camera, if the user only wants to scan the document/ID cardâ€™s front side, 
then once the area turns green the user will be shown an arrow with purple background, 
when the user clicks it, it will terminate further scanning and the current scanned information can be seen on the screen.**
